This is a diagram representing a web server infrastructure:


1- When the customer write www.foobar.com in the web browser, the computer needs to know the IP adress associated to this domain name(www.foobar.com).
So the client computer send a request to the DNS server provided by the operator(FAI). The DNS server receives the request a search in its data base the IP adress associated to the domain name.

2- Once it is founded, it retrieves it to the customer's computer.

3- An HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request is made by sending url request to the aimed server.

4- If the HTTP server detects that the received request is meant for the application server, it forwards it to the application server. The two servers are connected by a channel known as a connector.

4 bis- The relationship between the application server, database, and code base is a critical aspect of web application development. The code base contains the instructions for how the application should work, the application server executes these instructions, and the database stores and manages the data required for the application's operation

5- Once its response is generated, the application server sends it back to the web server through the connector. The web server retrieves it as if it had fetched a static resource itself. It has simply delegated the retrieval of the response, and the response has been generated, but it is no longer its concern.

6- The response is now pure HTML code, understandable by a browser. The HTTP server can, therefore, return the response to the client.



Web server:
The web server (e.g., Apache) is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. It processes all requests, whether they request static or dynamic resources. However, an HTTP server can only respond to requests for static resources. It can only serve existing HTML pages, images, and so on.

Application Server:
The application server plays a key role in handling dynamic content and application logic. When the web server identifies that a request requires processing, it forwards the request to the application server through a connector.
The application server executes the necessary code, interacts with the MySQL database, and generates dynamic content as a response. This can include user-specific data, personalized recommendations, or data retrieved from the database.

Database:
The database, in this case, MySQL, serves as the backend data storage for your web application. It stores information like user accounts, product details, and other data that your application relies on. The application server communicates with the database to fetch and update data as needed.

Communication with the User:
Communication between the server and the user's computer is achieved through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over the Internet. The web server sends the requested HTML and other static resources directly to the user's browser, while dynamic content generated by the application server is included in the HTML response.

Regarding the issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
One concern is the single server. If this server experiences hardware failure or any other issue, the entire website could become unavailable. To address this concern, redundancy measures or load balancing could be implemented.

Downtime during Maintenance:
Another issue is that during maintenance, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted. This can result in downtime, which can impact user experience. Implementing a solution that allows for rolling updates or redundancy can help mitigate this.

Scalability:
If the website experiences a sudden increase in traffic, a single server may not be able to handle the load effectively. To address this, you might consider load balancing, horizontal scaling, or using content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute the load.
